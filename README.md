# GNN--Recommendation_System
Master Thesis Project

Many Optimization problems can be represented either as a QuadraticUnconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) or as a graph, and selecting themost appropriate solver for a given problem remains a challenge. The currentmethods for solver selection rely on manual expertise and do not fully capturethe complex relationships between the inputs and solver outputs. Thisexpertise involves having a deep understanding of the problem and thedifferent solvers available, as well as the ability to match the characteristics ofthe problem with the strengths of the solver. However, this expertise can belimited and may not always lead to the most efficient or effective solverselection.The goal of this project is to develop a Recommendation System that usesGraph Neural Network (GNN) model to accurately predict a good solver, which performs better than the average for an optimization problem,regardless of its representation as either a QUBO or a graph. The GNN willtake either representation as input and provide a recommendation for theoptimal solver based on its ability to learn from and generalize to previouslyseen problems. This proposed solution will improve the efficiency andeffectiveness of solving optimization problems by increasing the accuracy ofsolver selection
